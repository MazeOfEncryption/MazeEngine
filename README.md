# MazeEngine
Simple OpenGL Game Engine
## Note
This repo is now in a transition-phase. I'm switching from just using makefiles and copies of libaries this repo to using cmake and git submodules. I think in the future I'd like to make MazeEngine a standalone library, and have other repos to demonstrate how it might be used. At the time being, don't expect this repo to do anything, as the code isn't functional and probably won't be for a while.
