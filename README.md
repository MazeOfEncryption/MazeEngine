# MazeEngine
Simple OpenGL Game Engine
## Note
Although this project was originally going to be a game engine, it has devolved into an OpenGL testing program for me. If you want to check out whatever I'm using it for, or even contribute to the code for it, go ahead. But, don't expect for this to be anything close to a functional game engine.
## Building
To build MazeEngine, open up a MinGW-64 shell, cd into the clone directory, and type `make`.
## Running
A precompiled build is already included in this repo. To run it or another build, simply execute `main.exe`. All required libraries and files should be included (for windows, at least).
