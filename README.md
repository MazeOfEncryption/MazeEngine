# MazeEngine
Simple OpenGL Game Engine
## Building
To build MazeEngine, open up a MinGW-64 shell, cd into the clone directory, and type `make`.
## Running
A precompiled build is already included in this repo. To run it or another build, simply execute `main.exe`. All required libraries and files should be included (for windows, at least).
