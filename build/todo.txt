Todo:
✔ Implement file loading method
✔ Implement shader compiler
✔ Use GLM Matricies
✔ Figure out GLFW mouse tracking / pointerlock
∙ Implement Basic Lighting
∙ Implement multi object and shader support
∙ Implement material files (shaders + textures + maps)
∙ Implement STL loading (maybe other formats, STL is easy to start with)
